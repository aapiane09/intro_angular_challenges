#Intro Angular Lab

The following challenges are designed to introduce you to Angular.  You will explore:
* Setting up an angular application
* Rendering data
* Creating a module
* Creating controllers
* Passing values between the controllers and views
* Two-way data binding
* "View-models" for scope

#### Setup
For each challenge, open the corresponding `index.html` page in your browser. E.g. `challenge_1/index.html`

Each `index.html` page has a series of instructions and exercises. On each page, follow the instructions to set up angular. Then move on to the exercises.

You will need to make changes in `index.html` and `app.js`.

> Keep your Chrome Developer Console open, and make sure you are modifying the `index.html` and `app.js` for the challenge you are working on!
